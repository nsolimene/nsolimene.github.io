      <p>Make a website!

We will first use a site called Github which is an excellent tool in managing software development with teams of people as well as tracking the evolution of your code over time.  First create a Github account herehttps://github.com/

Once you create your Github account, let us know your username by submitting it here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qAHil8ah4Qcln_USjYsL98qgd1nQbrEKpo53g2PPARQ/edit
We will next download some companion software called GitKraken which can be used as an interface between your Github account and files on your computer.  You can download this here: https://www.gitkraken.com/
Github offers a service called Github Pages that allows you to easily put static webpages online. We will be using that service for you to create your own personal website. The goals of this lab are:

for you to practice HTML and CSS
for you to practice committing and pushing in git

Find a partner to bounce ideas around, but you will each be working on your own webpage. Consider your partner as your first resource before asking other people.

Follow the instructions on https://pages.github.com/ to create a repository for your Github Page. Make sure your repository is named correctly - it must be YOUR_USER_NAME.github.io (where YOUR_USER_NAME is, well, your user name). You don't need to download Github Desktop - just copy the URL.

Clone the repository in GitKraken, and allow GitKraken to initialize the repository for you.

Open the folder as a new project in your favorite programming interface, or make a new folder and use a text editor. Create a new HTML file called index.html (note it should be all lower-case). The filename is important, since servers will look for this file by default.

Copy and paste this simple HTML into your file:

      <!DOCTYPE HTML>
      <html>
<head>

                     <meta charset="utf-8">
      <title>Hello, World!</title>
             </head>
<body>

                     Hello, World!
             </body>
</html>

Back in GitKraken, stage, commit, and push your file to Github.

Go to https://YOUR_USER_NAME.github.io - you should see the hello world page you just created. If you get an error, double check that your repository name and your URL are correct. If it still doesn't show up, wait a couple minutes and try again.

The remainder of this lab is for you to create a simple webpage. Here are some requirements for your webpage, which many of your designs already fulfill:

* Have at least one image
* Styled using CSS
* Contain a link to somewhere on the internet

This is likely your first time writing anything in html or CSS, so here are some resources to help you with your work:
